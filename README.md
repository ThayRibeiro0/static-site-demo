## Deployment of Static App on Render - Bootcamp activity

- Create a folder locally
- Move the contents of activity 2 into that folder (DONT MOVE THE WHOLE FOLDER JUST WHATS INSIDE OF IT)
- Git init in the folder
- Push up a repo
- deploy as a static app to render with dist as the publish directory and npm install && npm build as the build command
